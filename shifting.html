            <h3>About</h3>
            <div style="padding-bottom: 24px;" class="text">The Light Shifting Display is a novel type of low-resolution lighting display that presents real-time information in an ambient manner through various information encodings. The prototype features a discrete and continuous display mode to support a wide range of visual representations and to explore the boundaries between display and luminaire design.</div>
            <div class="text">I developed the Light Shifting Display during a research stay at the Design Lab at the University of Sydney. The project was conducted in close collaboration with a partner from the industry. The prototype was evaluated in a real-world context in three family households over several weeks, displaying energy performance data. Preliminary findings indicate that the display gained a lot of attention and might provide a promising alternative towards high-resolution media in the Internet of Things Era.</div>

            <h3>Design Process</h3>
            <div class="text">Following a human-centered design process, experts and end-users were involved during the concept development phase. Therefore, the purpose-built prototyping toolkit Sketching-in-Light was used as a creative enabler during several co-design activities. In this sessions, workshop participants created various visualisation concepts for the Light Shifting Display. Results from this low-fidelity prototyping activities were systematically analysed and fed into the next process stages.</div>

            <h3>Evaluation</h3>
            <div class="text">In the course of a long-term user study, we deployed the Light Shifting Display in three family households over seven weeks in total. Quantitative data in the form of interaction logs and qualitative data obtained through interviews after the deployment, indicated that the participants were engaged through the prototype and used it during the whole time of the deployment. Key findings include that all participants preferred to access the energy performance data via the Light Shifting Display instead of using the existing web app that is provided by our industrial partner.</div>
